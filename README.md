## Player Lookup
This tool can be used to view statistics, online status, and other information for LichenTown members.

## Usage
To use, simply input the valid username of someone who has joined the server, and click **Get Player**.<br>
You should see a card appear with information about that person, including statistics and whether or not they are on the server currently!

## Data
Data is fetched from [player-stats](../../../player-stats), which means it is **not** automatically updated.<br>
Player data can be updated by committing updated statistics to that repo.
